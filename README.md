# accordion

In this Python script, we define an accordion() function that simulates the accordion behavior. We have a list of sections with their titles and content. The user can select a section to expand and view its content. The loop continues until the user enters 'q' to quit the accordion.
To use this, create a new Python file named accordion.py and paste the above code into it. Then, run the script using a Python interpreter:

python accordion.py

The script will display a list of sections with numbers. Enter the number of the section you want to expand, and it will display the corresponding content. You can keep expanding other sections or enter 'q' to quit the accordion.
